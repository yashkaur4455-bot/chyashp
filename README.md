Hi, I’m Yash

I’m a Frontend Developer based in Canada, focused on building user-facing web
applications using React and modern JavaScript.

I have professional experience working on production web applications,
including internal platforms and data-driven interfaces. My work has involved
building reusable UI components, integrating REST APIs, and improving
application reliability and user experience.

More recently, I’ve been working with React in collaborative environments,
contributing to team-based projects and mentoring developers. I enjoy writing
clean, maintainable code and focusing on predictable state management and
responsive UI.

Tech stack:
- React, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS
- Redux, Redux Toolkit
- Firebase, Appwrite
- Git, GitHub, Vercel

Current work:
- Frontend Developer and React Mentor at Code the Dream
- React Developer (Volunteer) at Chingu

Projects include social media-style applications, data-driven dashboards,
and personal portfolio website deployed on Vercel.
